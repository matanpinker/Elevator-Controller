# Elevator-Controller
This project is an implementation of an elevator controller using the Delfino microcontroller. The system is programmed in C language and utilizes the hardware resources of the Delfino to control the movement of an elevator in a multi-floor building. The code implements various control algorithms to manage the elevator's movements and prioritize its requests efficiently
